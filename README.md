# Breast Cancer Classification Models

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of machine learning models for breast cancer diagnosis using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)** dataset. The project was initially developed collaboratively by **Christine Wu**, **Haoyuan Liu**, and **Harsimran Kaur** as part of the **UC Berkeley Extension ML Course** and was later extended and refined by **Christine Wu** and **Kitty Li** for a machine learning course at **NYU**.

## Introduction

Breast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide. Early detection and accurate classification of tumors as **Malignant (M)** or **Benign (B)** are critical for effective treatment. This project aims to automate breast cancer diagnosis by evaluating and comparing the following machine learning models:

1. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
2. **Decision Trees (DT)**
3. **Random Forests (RF)**
4. **Stacked Ensemble Model**

We utilized advanced techniques such as **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and **DBSCAN Clustering** for exploratory analysis, alongside traditional feature selection methods.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data), which contains 569 instances and 32 attributes, including:

- **30 numerical features** extracted from Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) biopsies.
- **Target variable**: `diagnosis` (Benign or Malignant).

### Data Cleaning
- Removed rows with zero or invalid values.
- Detected and removed outliers using a custom function based on the IQR rule.

### Feature Selection
- Applied **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** feature importance scores to identify the top 20 features.

## Methodology

1. **Data Visualization**:
   - Histograms and heat maps for feature correlations.
   - Pairwise plots to assess separability of malignant vs. benign cases.

2. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Conducted PCA to reduce data dimensions and visualize separability in 2D.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Trained and tuned SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Stacked Ensemble models.
   - Hyperparameter tuning via **GridSearchCV**.

4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Accuracy, RÂ², Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Results

### Key Findings:
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** achieved the highest accuracy of **98.2%** after feature selection and tuning.
- PCA and DBSCAN clustering confirmed clear class separability along principal components.
- While the **Stacked Ensemble Model** provided robust results (97.3% accuracy), it failed to outperform the standalone SVM.

### Model Performance Summary:

| Model           | Accuracy Before FS | Accuracy After FS |
|------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Decision Tree    | 95.50%            | 95.50%           |
| Random Forest    | 96.40%            | 97.30%           |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | 97.30% | **98.20%**       |
| Stacked Ensemble | 97.30%            | 97.30%           |
